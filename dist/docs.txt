* So we will illustrate that how you can download the SDK and integrate.(through a link to script file and creating the reference to project by 
putting in API key). 

there will be two tables at the start; one for input, other for output

For input the format will contain following things 
1: argument name
2: type (like is it a string or object)
3: is it required or optional

In the output table, we will illustrate the composition of the promise which will be returned. Like what will 
be the format of output object.

Then finally we will put in all the error codes or success code that it will return.

Finally we will put in a short code snippet as an illustration (optional for now)
